In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

SELECT *
FROM jansales
LIMIT 20;

SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMTI 20;

--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.Jansales
GROUP BY PRODUCT;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, 
--how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT* FROM FebSales;

SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, 
--and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT  count(distinct customers.acctnum),avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00';

SELECT location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate = '02/18/19 01:35';

SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%';

SELECT orderdate from BIT_DB.FebSales;

SELECT distinct Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Batteries%';

SELECT distinct Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Price like '%.99';

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
